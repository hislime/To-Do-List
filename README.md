# To-Do-List
This is a functional To-Do List web application that allows users to add, manage, and organize their tasks. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages localStorage to ensure that tasks persist even when the page is reloaded. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, filter them by status (All, Completed, Pending), and delete tasks.
Features
1.	Add Tasks: Users can input and add a task to the task list.
2.	Mark Tasks as Completed: Clicking the "Complete" button toggles a task between completed and pending.
3.	Undo Completed Tasks: Completed tasks can be undone and returned to the pending state.
4.	Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks individually.
5.	5.	Filter Tasks: Users can filter tasks to view:
      
o	All Tasks: Shows all tasks regardless of their status.
o	Completed Tasks: Shows only the tasks marked as completed.
o	Pending Tasks: Shows only the tasks that are still pending
